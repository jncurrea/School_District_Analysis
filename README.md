# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project is to perform an analysis of a school district's grades after a situation of dishonesty for certain students. This analysis plans to uncov er new information and changes that would happen to the grades if the grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School were not valid.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
- Given the dishonesty situation that happened at Thomas High School, we were asked to perform the analysis two times. The first image below will show the district summary taking into account all the data including Thomas High School. The second image below, shows district summary after the schores of the ninth graders from Thomas High School were ommitted.

- How is Thomas High School Summary affected?
- After the incident, one can get a glimpse of the situation. After the incident, one can notice how the average math score decreased, giving a slight reason to think that some of the 9th graders were actually being dishonest. However, it is also evident how the average reading grades rise when the 9th grader scores are not taking into account. Thus, one cannot assume due to this that the 9th graders at Thomas High School were cheating.

- Additional to these scores slightly changing, one can also evidence that Thomas High School is not part of the top 5 better schools after the incident.
  - Before the incident: We can evidence that Thomas High School was in the top 5 better schools with an overall pass percentage above 90%.
